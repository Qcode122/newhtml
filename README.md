# COVID19 TRACKER

The project tracks the rate of increase of coronavirus for the past months..
It is called from an api and is updated everyday and updates the number depending on the date of the month...
All you need to do is to input the country you want to see and it will show the graph of increase or decrease in the rate of coronavirus and its numbers..
You may need to refresh the pages at times..
Some countries may not end at the exact date... as the api does not provide the other dates from january in such cases the test cases for january is 0..
